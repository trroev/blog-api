# BLOG API

The objective of this project was to construct a RESTful API that serves as a foundation for a blog client and content management system (CMS). This included implementing Passport authentication utilizing JSON web tokens to ensure secure access to the API. Through this project, I gained valuable experience in creating RESTful APIs and implementing secure API practices.

## How It's Made:

**Built with:**

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
